        <h2>Front End Developer</h2>
        <p>I am Prisha Bansal, a dynamic third-year law scholar hailing from Amity University, Madhya Pradesh. My academic voyage has been distinguished, notably as a Semi-Finalist in the AUMP 2022 Intra Moot Court Competition. Articulation and persuasion are my forte – evident through my triumph at the "Amrit Mohotsav Debate" on the state level and my commendable achievement securing bronze in the intellectually stimulating "Dialectic Reasoning Competition" organized by Parikalp. I have not only graced events as an engaging Anchor but also garnered recognition as the Runner-Up in the AUMP Client Counselling Competition of 2023. Demonstrating adeptness in multitasking, I actively fulfill the roles of Secretariat Member within the MUN Committee, contribute to the National Service Scheme, and selflessly engage as a volunteer for the Cultural and Moot Court Committees. I extend an invitation to embark on an expedition characterized by engaging banter, diplomatic finesse, and harmonious collaboration.</p>
